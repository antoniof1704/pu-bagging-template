# pu-bagging-template
A template for a PU Bagging approach. PU bagging is effective when reliable negatives can't be identified in unlabeled data. Bootstrapping creates resampled subsets, helping the model distinguish true positives from true negatives. This process infers the negative class distribution, improving classification and model robustness.
